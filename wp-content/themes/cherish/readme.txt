= Description ==
Cherish is an accessible, full width responsive theme with a fixed top menu. 
It has 3 widget areas in the footer and you can change the background color of your posts. 
Edit or disable your Call to Action area in the customizer, where you can also change colors, hide your post meta and upload your own logo.

== Installation ==
1. Unzip `cherish.zip` to the `/wp-content/themes/` directory
2. Activate the theme through the 'Appearance' menu in WordPress

== Known Limitations ==
-A one line menu is strongly recommended, instead of using long menus, use submenus.
-It's recommended not to use a font-size larger than 4em for the Call to Action area.
